<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>Snow White was now all alone in the great forest, and she did not know what to do.
    The trees seemed to whisper to each other, scaring Snow White who began to run.  She ran over sharp stones and through thorns.
    She ran as far as her feet could carry her, and just as evening was about to fall she saw a little house and went inside in
    order to rest.</p>

<p>Inside the house everything was small but tidy.  There was a little table with a tidy, white tablecloth and seven little plates.
    Against the wall there were seven little beds, all in a row and covered with quilts.</p>

<p>Because she was so hungry Snow White ate a few vegetables and a little bread from each little plate and from each cup she drank a
    bit of milk. Afterward, because she was so tired, she lay down on one of the little beds and fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>After dark, the owners of the house returned home.  They were the seven dwarves who mined for gold in the mountains.
    As soon as they arrived home, they saw that someone had been there, for not everything was in the same order as they had left it.</p>

<p>The first one said: <b><i>"Who has been sitting in my chair?"</i></b></p>

<p>The second one said: <b><i>"Who has been eating from my plate?"</i></b></p>

<p>The third one said: <b><i>"Who has been eating my bread?"</i></b></p>

<p>The fourth one said: <i><b>"Who has been eating my vegetables?"</b></i></p>

<p>The fifth one said: <b><i>"Who has been eating with my fork?"</i></b></p>

<p>The sixth one said: <i><b>"Who has been drinking from my cup?"</b></i></p>

<p>But the seventh one, looking at his bed, found Snow White lying there asleep.
    The seven dwarves all came running up, and they cried out with amazement.
    They fetched their seven candles and shone the light on Snow White.</p>

<p><i><b>"Oh good heaven!"</b></i> they cried. <i><b>"This child is beautiful!"</b></i></p>

<p>They were so happy that they did not wake her up, but let her continue to sleep in the bed.
    The next morning Snow White woke up, and when she saw the seven dwarves she was frightened.
    But they were friendly and asked, <i><b>"What is your name?"</b></i></p>

<p><i><b>"My name is Snow White,"</b></i> she answered.</p>

<p><i><b>"How did you find your way to our house?"</b></i> the dwarves asked further.</p>

<p>Then she told them that her stepmother had tried to kill her, that the huntsman had spared her life, and that she had run the
    entire day through the forest, finally stumbling upon their house.</p>

<p>The dwarves spoke with each other for awhile and then said, <i><b>"If you will keep house for us, and cook, make beds, wash,
    sew, and knit, and keep everything clean and orderly, then you can stay with us, and you shall have everything that you want."</b></i></p>

<p><i><b>"Yes"</b></i>, said Snow White, <i><b>"with all my heart."</b></i>  For Snow White greatly enjoyed keeping a tidy home.</p>

<p>So Snow White lived happily with the dwarves.  Every morning they went into the mountains looking for gold,
    and in the evening when they came back home Snow White had their meal ready and their house tidy.
    During the day the girl was alone, except for the small animals of the forest that she often played with.</p>

<p>Now the queen, believing that she had eaten Snow White's heart, could only think that she was again the first and the
    most beautiful woman of all.  She stepped before her mirror and said:</p>

<p><i><b>"Mirror, mirror, on the wall,<br>
    Who in this land is fairest of all?"</b></i></p>

<p>It answered:</p>

<p><i><b>"You, my queen, are fair; it is true.<br>
    But Snow White, beyond the mountains<br>
    With the seven dwarves,<br>
    Is still a thousand times fairer than you."</b></i></p>

<p>This startled the queen, for she knew that the mirror did not lie, and she realized that the huntsman had deceived her and that
    Snow White was still alive.  Then she thought, and thought again, how she could rid herself of Snow White,
    for as long as she was not the most beautiful woman in the entire land her jealousy would give her no rest.</p>

<p>At last she thought of something.  She went into her most secret room, no one else was allowed inside,
    and she made a poisoned apple.  From the outside it was beautiful, and anyone who saw it would want it.
    But anyone who might eat a little piece of it would die.  Coloring her face, she disguised herself as an old peddler woman,
    so that no one would recognize her. She then traveled to the dwarves house and knocked on the door.</p>

<p>Snow White put her head out of the window, and said, <i><b>"I must not let anyone in; the seven dwarves have forbidden me to do so."</b></i></p>

<p><i><b>"That is all right with me"</b></i>, answered the peddler woman. <i><b>"I'll easily get rid of my apples. Here, I'll give you one of
    them."</b></i></p>

<p><i><b>"No"</b></i>, said Snow White, <i><b>"I cannot accept anything from strangers."</b></i></p>

<p><i><b>"Are you afraid of poison?"</b></i> asked the old woman. <i><b>"Look, I'll cut the apple in two.  You eat half and I shall eat half."</b></i></p>

<p>The apple had been so artfully made that only the one half was poisoned.  Snow White longed for the beautiful apple, and when she saw that the
    peddler woman was eating part of it she could no longer resist, and she stuck her hand out and took the poisoned half.
    She barely had a bite in her mouth when she fell to the ground dead.</p>

<p>The queen looked at her with an evil stare, laughed loudly, and said, <i><b>"White as snow, red as blood, black as ebony wood!  The dwarves shall
    never awaken you."</b></i></p>

<p>Back at home she asked her mirror:</p>

<p><i><b>Mirror, mirror, on the wall,<br>
    Who in this land is fairest of all?</b></i></p>

<p>It finally answered:</p>

<p><i><b>You, my queen, are fairest of all.</b></i></p>

<p>Then her cruel and jealous heart was at rest, as well as a cruel and jealous heart can be at rest.</p>

<p>When the dwarves came home that evening they found Snow White lying on the ground.  She was not breathing at all.  She was dead.
    They lifted her up and looked at her longingly.  They talked to her, shook her and wept over her.  But nothing helped.
    The dear child was dead, and she remained dead.  They laid her on a bed of straw, and all seven sat next to her and mourned for her and cried for
    three days.  They were going to bury her, but she still looked as fresh as a living person, and still had her beautiful red cheeks.</p>

<p>They said, <b><i>"We cannot bury her in the black earth,"</i></b> and they had a transparent glass coffin made, so she could be seen from all sides.
    They laid her inside, and with golden letters wrote on it her name, and that she was a princess.  Then they put the coffin outside on a mountain,
    and one of them always stayed with it and watched over her.  The animals too came and mourned for Snow White, first an owl, then a raven, and
    finally a dove.</p>
