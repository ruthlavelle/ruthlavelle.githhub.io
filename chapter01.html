<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

        <p>Once upon a time, long, long ago a king and queen ruled over a distant land. The queen was kind and lovely and
            all the people of the realm adored her.
            The only sadness in the queen's life was that she wished for a child, but did not have one.</p>

        <p>One winter day, the queen was doing needle work while gazing out her ebony window at the new fallen snow.
            A bird flew by the window startling the queen and she pricked her finger.
            A single drop of blood fell on the snow outside her window.  As she looked at the blood on the snow she said to herself:</p>

        <p><i><b>"Oh, how I wish that I had a daughter that had skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony."</b></i></p>

        <p> Soon after that, the kind queen got her wish when she gave birth to a baby girl who had skin as white as snow, lips red as
            blood, and hair black as ebony.  They named the baby princess Snow White, but sadly, the queen died after giving birth
            to Snow White.</p>

        <p>Soon after, the king married a new woman who was beautiful, but proud and cruel.
            She had studied dark magic and owned a magic mirror, of which she would daily ask:</p>

        <p><i><b>"Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?"</b></i></p>

        <p>Each time this question was asked, the mirror would give the same answer:</p>

        <p><i><b>"Thou, O Queen, art the fairest of all."</b></i></p>

        <p>This pleased the queen greatly as she knew that her magical mirror could speak nothing but the truth.</p>

        <p>One morning when the queen asked:</p>

        <p><b><i> "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?"</i></b></p>

        <p>She was shocked when it answered:</p>

        <p><i><b>"You, my queen, are fair; it is true.<br> But Snow White is even fairer than you."</b></i></p>

        <p>The Queen flew into a jealous rage and ordered her huntsman to take Snow White into the woods to be killed. She demanded that the huntsman return with Snow White's heart as proof.</p>

        <p>The poor huntsman took Snow White into the forest, but found himself unable to kill the girl. Instead, he let her go, and brought the queen the heart of a wild boar.</p>
