<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>Now it came to pass that a prince entered these woods and happened onto the dwarves' house, where he sought shelter for the night .
    He saw the coffin on the mountain with beautiful Snow White in it, and he read what was written on it with golden letters.</p>

<p>Then he said to the dwarves, <i>"Let me have the coffin.  I will give you anything you want for it."</i></p>

<p>But the dwarves answered, <i>"We will not sell it for all the gold in the world."</i></p>

<p>Then he said, <i>"Then give it to me, for I cannot live without being able to see Snow White.  I will honor her and respect her as my most
    cherished one."</i></p>

<p>As he thus spoke, the good dwarves felt pity for him and gave him the coffin.  The prince had his servants carry it away on their shoulders.
    But then it happened that one of them stumbled on some brush, and this dislodged from Snow White's throat the piece of poisoned apple that she had
    bitten off.  Not long afterward she opened her eyes, lifted the lid from her coffin, sat up, and was alive again.</p>

<p><i>"Good heavens, where am I?"</i> she cried out.</p>

<p>The prince said joyfully, <i>"You are with me."</i>  He told her what had happened, and then said, <i>"I love you more than anything else in the world.
    Come with me to my father's castle.  You shall become my wife."</i>  Snow White loved him, and she went with him.
    Their wedding was planned with great splendor and majesty.</p>

<p>Snow White's wicked step-mother was invited to the feast, and when she had arrayed herself in her most beautiful garments, she stood before her mirror,
    and said:</p>

<p><i>Mirror, mirror, on the wall,<br>
    Who in this land is fairest of all?</i></p>

<p>The mirror answered:<br>
<i>You, my queen, are fair; it is true.<br>
    But the young queen is a thousand times fairer than you.</i></p>

<p>Not knowing that this new queen was indeed her stepdaughter, she arrived at the wedding, and her heart filled with the deepest of
    dread when she realized the truth - the evil queen was banished from the land forever and the prince and Snow White lived happily ever after.</p>
