<h2>Chapter 3 - Alternative Ending </h2>

<p> The sky has been recently overcast with heavy clouds that enshrouded the once sunny, pleasant day all of a sudden.
    Rain is pouring down and thunder roars in the darkened sky, and barely anything is visible in the dimmed woods.
    The trees look frightening, big and small alike, with their thin, bent branches resembling menacing talons who would like to snatch a
    passerby away to a world of unearthly torments in their hollow insides. An old, hideous women, dressed in a black, hooded robe makes her way through the woods with all
    the speed that she can possibly muster, for she is running for her wretched life. She shows more vigor than would be expected for someone looking so very aged.
    Not too far from where she’s currently at, a group of seven little men, mounted on deers and accompanied by the woodland animals,
    chase after her bellowing with anger and sheer hatred. One of them, called Grumpy cries out to his companions: <b><i>"After her! She’s getting away!"</i></b></p>

<p>The old woman desperately tries to keep her distance but they are slowly catching up to her. She grabs onto a rock and starts climbing up a cliff,
    quite weary and drenched in raindrops and her own sweat.<p>

<p>The old woman says to herself: <b><i>"Those fools… I cannot… They… I won’t let them… catch me…"</i></b> and resumes climbing up the mountain with doubled effort. By then, the dwarves have also started to climb up the hill.
    One cries out <b><i>"Where could she be?"</i></b> when another spots her. The dwarves move towards the old woman swinging their sharp, sturdy blades and shouting imprecations.</p>

<p>The witch at last reaches the brink of the cliff and is unable to move forward. The dwarfs have gotten her cornered. Two grim-looking vultures with bloodshot eyes,
    who had been on the lookout from afar, watch gleefully as the pursuit unfolds before their eyes.</p>

<p>With tears in their eyes, the dwarves shout out to her: <b><i>"You’re gonna pay for what you did to Snow White!"</i></b>

<p> The old woman begins to worry and thinks to herself <b><i>"I’m trapped… What… What will I do?! Those pesky little cretins!"</i></b>. She Glances sideways in a panicky manner,
    and notices a large boulder and a stick with which she can propel it forward. With restored hope and a renewed smirk she grabs the stick. <b><i>"No! I’ll get you!"</i></b> she
    screams. The dwarves’ faces are horror-stricken as they notice the huge boulder right in front of them. <b><i>"I’LL CRUSH YOUR BONES!"</i></b> she screams again as she
    pushes the boulder using the stick, pressing it onwards.

<p><b><i>"Victory is mine!"</i></b> the woman shouts. Thunder strikes not too far from where she stands and she is finally able to move the boulder from its spot,
    and it starts rolling downwards.</p>

<p>The dwarfs try to steer clear of the rock’s collision course, but all for naught. They meet an instant but gruesome demise as the boulder squishes the seven dwarves’
    blood out of their now mangled bodies. All the while the witch keeps laughing in utter derision. Meanwhile, the vultures fly down to what’s left of the seven dwarves,
    their beaks soon to become stained with blood.</p>

<p>Upon returning to the castle, the queen looks in to her mirror and says: <br>
    <b><i>Magic mirror on the wall, do tell me, now. Who is the fairest of them all?</i></b></p>

<p>The mirror says:<br> <b><i>"Snow White lies dead, and dead shall remain. Thou my queen are the fairest in the land once again."</i></b>
